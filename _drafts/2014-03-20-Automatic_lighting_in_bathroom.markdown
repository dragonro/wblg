Automatically turning lights on and off is one of the first projects one thinks about when talking about home automation. We press switches dozens of times a day, sometimes when our hands are full, and we often forget to turn off the lights, which consumes energy and wears down the bulbs.
This article presents a successful project of automating the lighting of my bathroom. It represents only a first step.

# Why?
## Incandescent light bulbs
## I saw this in public toilets and peed my pants. Will it work?
# Architecture
## Motion sensor
## What kind of load

# Implementation
