I have an old battery powered alarm clock. It's small, tuned automatically by [DCF77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCF77), and it works well - but I got another as a gift so I am no longer using this one.
I've noticed, like many people, that I wake up more easily and in a better mood when there is light in the room, hence the idea of turning this old alarm clock into a sunrise clock. I am experimenting with LEDs and this project will be a great opportunity to try out LED strips - and the strip can be RGB, allowing the clock to simulate sunrise and sunset by doing color gradients!

Below are pictures of the unmodified clock.
